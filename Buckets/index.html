      <h1>Buckets!</h1>
      <p>Buckets! is a quick and dirty sample game that will challenge your hand-eye coordination. See how fast you can sort the different circles on the canvas into their respective buckets using their colours as a guide. Challenge yourself by adding more circles through the configurable difficulty setting of the application.</p>

      <p>Written in <a href="http://paperjs.org/">paper.js</a> it is intended to show what is possible with some of the technologies that will be covered in this course. Paper.js hides a lot of the underlying complexities, but Buckets! itself shares the same essential structure as any video game. Namely, it contains a scene graph, user input management, game state tracking, and a game loop.</p>
